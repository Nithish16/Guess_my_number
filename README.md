Guess my number - is my first project in javascript....
Enter number between 1 to 20 in the empty box and click check button to find the secret number hidden behind the gray box. 
if the secret number is same as your number then wins the game and you score will be set as high score in the right bottom.
If you enter a number which is higher than the secret number then you will receive a message as Too high.
If you enter a number which is lower than the secret number then you will receive a message as Too low.
Each incorrect attempt wil decrease your score. If your score goes to 0 then you loss the game.
press again button to reset the game but this will not reset the high score.
